# cosine_sim_NN
 Novel Neural Network archietecture using sharpened cosine similairty as an alternative to convolutions
 
This is a project I submitted for the CS4465 - Computational Biology course at the City University of Hong Kong. I experimented on the potential of cosine simililarity as an alternative to convolutions as feature detectors for neural networks. And while the results were promising, alot more work has to be done to make this usable.
